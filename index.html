          <h2>Bio</h2>
          <p>
            My name is Sydney Stiward, and I am a Mexican-American born and raised in Phoenix, Arizona by my immigrant parents. 
            Maybe as a child I was never able to afford it, but Technology seemed to be something that always interested me. 
            I have finally decided to take the step and pursue the things that catch my eye. Entering tech is something I 
            thought was far from me, but at the end of the day the only one that was stopping me was; me.
